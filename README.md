# Gitlab
This is a Gitlab server which would come up with a compose file.
Also the web-console of this Server has been proxy-pass by a Nginx server. Then you can ser a record in DNS to see Gitlab server with name. Also we can add another server-block in nginx.conf to have another server behind our Nginx.
This project would be better to have HA-proxy with Nginx.
